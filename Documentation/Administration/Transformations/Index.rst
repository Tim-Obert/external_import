Transformations configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of properties relate to transforming the data during the import process.
All of these properties are used during the "Transform data" step. They are
sub-properties of the :ref:`transformations property <administration-columns-properties-transformations>`.

.. _administration-columns-properties-mapping:
.. _administration-transformations-properties-mapping:

mapping
~~~~~~~

Type
  :ref:`Mapping configuration <administration-mapping>`

Description
  This property can be used to map values from the external data to
  values coming from some internal table. A typical example might be to
  match 2-letter country ISO codes to the uid of the "static\_countries"
  table.

Scope
  Transform data


.. _administration-columns-properties-value:
.. _administration-transformations-properties-value:

value
~~~~~

Type
  Simple type (string, integer, boolean)

Description
  With this property, it is possible to set a fixed value for a given
  field. For example, this might be used to set a flag for all imported
  records.

Scope
  Transform data


.. _administration-columns-properties-trim:
.. _administration-transformations-properties-trim:

trim
~~~~

Type
  boolean

Description
  If set to :code:`true`, every value for this column will be trimmed during the
  transformation step.

Scope
  Transform data


.. _administration-columns-properties-rteenabled:
.. _administration-transformations-properties-rteenabled:

rteEnabled
~~~~~~~~~~

Type
  boolean

Description
  If set to :code:`true` when importing HTML data into a RTE-enable field, the
  imported data will go through the usual RTE transformation process on
  the way to the database.

Scope
  Transform data


.. _administration-columns-properties-userfunc:
.. _administration-transformations-properties-userfunc:

userFunc
~~~~~~~~

Type
  array

Description
  This property has been renamed :ref:`userFunction <administration-transformations-properties-userfunction>`.
  Backwards-compatibility is ensured for now, but please update your
  configuration as soon as possible.

Scope
  Transform data


.. _administration-transformations-properties-userfunction:

userFunction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type
  array

Description
  This property can be used to define a function that will be called on
  each record to transform the data from the given field. See example
  below.

  **Example**

  Here is a sample setup referencing a user function:

  .. code-block:: php

		$GLOBALS['TCA']['fe_users']['columns']['starttime']['external'] = [
				0 => [
						'field' => 'start_date',
						'transformations' => [
								10 => [
										'userFunction' => [
												'class' => \Cobweb\ExternalImport\Task\DateTimeTransformation::class,
												'method' => 'parseDate'
										]
								]
						]
				]
		];

  The definition of a user function takes three parameters:

  class
    *(string)* Required. Name of the class to be instantiated.

  method
    *(string)* Required. Name of the method that should be called.

  parameters (formerly "params")
    *(array)* Optional. Can contain any number of data, which will be passed
    to the method. This used to be called "params". Backwards-compatibility is
    ensured for now, but please update your configuration as soon as possible.

  In the example above we are using a sample class provided by
  External Import that can be used to parse a date and either return it
  as a timestamp or format it using either of the PHP functions
  :code:`date()` or :code:`strftime()` .

  .. note::

     Since External Import 5.1.0, if the user function throws an exception while
     handling a value, that value will be unset and thus removed from the imported
     dataset. The rationale is that such a value is considered invalid and should not
     be further processed nor saved to the database.

     The user function can also specifically throw the
     :php:`\Cobweb\ExternalImport\Exception\InvalidRecordException`. The effect is to
     remove the entire record from the imported dataset.

  For more details about creating a user function, please refer to the
  :ref:`Developer's Guide <developer-user-functions>`.
